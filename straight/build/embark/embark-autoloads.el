(defun embark--record-this-command nil "\
Record command which opened the minibuffer.
We record this because it will be the default action.
This function is meant to be added to `minibuffer-setup-hook'." (setq-local embark--command this-command))

(autoload 'embark-act "embark" "\
Prompt the user for an action and perform it.
The target of the action is chosen by `embark-target-finders'.
By default, if called from a minibuffer the target is the top
completion candidate, if called from an Embark Collect or a
Completions buffer it is the candidate at point.

This command uses `embark-prompter' to ask the user to specify an
action, and calls it injecting the target at the first minibuffer
prompt.

If you call this from the minibuffer, it can optionally quit the
minibuffer.  The variable `embark-quit-after-action' controls
whether calling `embark-act' with nil ARG quits the minibuffer,
and if ARG is non-nil it will do the opposite.  Interactively,
ARG is the prefix argument.

\(fn &optional ARG)" t nil)

(autoload 'embark-become "embark" "\
Make current command become a different command.
Take the current minibuffer input as initial input for new
command.  The new command can be run normally using keybindings or
\\[execute-extended-command], but if the current command is found in a keymap in
`embark-become-keymaps', that keymap is activated to provide
convenient access to the other commands in it.

If FULL is non-nil (interactively, if called with a prefix
argument), the entire minibuffer contents are used as the initial
input of the new command.  By default only the part of the
minibuffer contents between the current completion boundaries is
taken.  What this means is fairly technical, but (1) usually
there is no difference: the completion boundaries include the
entire minibuffer contents, and (2) the most common case where
these notions differ is file completion, in which case the
completion boundaries single out the path component containing
point.

\(fn &optional FULL)" t nil)

(autoload 'embark-collect-live "embark" "\
Create a live-updating Embark Collect buffer.
Optionally start in INITIAL-VIEW (either `list' or `grid')
instead of what `embark-collect-initial-view-alist' specifies.
Interactively, \\[universal-argument] means grid view, a prefix
argument of 1 means list view.
